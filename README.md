# TFEHelper

TFE stands for "**T**rabajo **F**inal de **E**specializacion" (final project for post-degree specialization) and TFEHelper is a single user tool designed for helping students on the collection and curate of diverse academic articles from the internet, when a [Systematic Literature Review (SLR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review) is needed.

With TFEHelper, users can:
- Import, normalize, convert and export data sources to and from [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) or [BibTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) files.
- Connect to several academic data sources for articles collection.
- Keep information centralized in order to ease their classification work.
